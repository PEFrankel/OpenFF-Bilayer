## Errors

Errors were put just according to the procedure of getting floating point numbers from paper image. We must put half size of the plot marker as a error for every value. The word "error" was not mentioned in the paper.

## Annotations

We annotated everything in the same way as we did for the dataset of the same author (10.1039/B418131J).

## Diastereotopic protons

For g-1: S-proton (**G1H2** here) should have close to zero OP (NMRlipids paper I: Botan, 2015).

For C2 protons, according to this paper of the same author (10.1039/B418131J), splitting here is related to sn-1 and sn-2 whereas diastereotopic protons of sn-2 were not distinguished in this dataset.

## Selection between sn-1 and sn-2 for protons.

For C2, we look into the paper of the same author (10.1039/B418131J) and annotated points according to it. For C3, C12 the values are not that different, and there have no clues how to annotate them. However we know that generally, OP values of sn-2 FA are shifted approximately by one position upper. According to that we decided:
12a = sn-2 C12
3a = sn-2 C3
2a = sn-2 C2
