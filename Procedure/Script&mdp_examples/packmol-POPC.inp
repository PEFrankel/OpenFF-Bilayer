# Water molecules below the lipids:
# The first three numbers are the minimum x, y, z coordinates for this

# First lipid layer: the polar head is oriented to down to the water
# molecules.
# 64 lipids will be put inside a box of size 70 in the x and y
# directions and 30 in the z direction (30 is a little more than the 
# length of the molecule). The atom 10 of the pdb file of this
# lipid, which belongs to the polar head (nitrogen specifically), will be constrained to be
# below the the plane z = 2, and the atoms 31 and 50 (one carbon from each tail), which are at the
# hydrophobic end of the lipid and will be constrained to be over the plane
# z = 28. Therefore, all the lipids will be oriented, with their polar
# heads pointing to the water box below.
