Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 3.5%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 65%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.3%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 % Z 0 %
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.329
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 12.7 %

NOTE: 12.7 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
