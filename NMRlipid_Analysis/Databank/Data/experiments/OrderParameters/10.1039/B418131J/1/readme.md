## Errors

Errors were put just according to the existance of two digits in all numbers. So we must put either 0.005 or 0.01. We put the second one. The word "error" was not mentioned in the paper.

## Annotations

There are determined some OP values form middle FA carbons. There are labelled as N[a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i] and are not associated with any of carbonds. That's why we just skip them. Their attributing is very arbitrary so we just skip that for this stage.

## Diastereotopic protons

For g-1: S-proton (**G1H2** here) should have close to zero OP (NMRlipids paper I: Botan, 2015).

For C2 protons, according to this paper on DPPC (Engel, Cowburn, 1981), R-proton's OP is more negative, S-proton's OP is less negative. Note, that in DMPC CHARMM notation proton naming are mixed: H2S proton is "R" whereas "H2R" is "S".


## Selection between sn-1 and sn-2 for protons.

For C2, the selection is clear because only sn-2 C2 protons have different OP values. For C3, C12, C13 the values are not that different, and there have no clues how to annotate them. However we know that generally, OP values of sn-2 FA are shifted approximately by one position upper. According to that we decided:
12a = sn-2 C12
13a = sn-2 C13
3a = sn-2 C3
2a = sn-2 C2
